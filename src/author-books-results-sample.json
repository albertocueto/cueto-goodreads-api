  And return to men the Shards they once bore.
  The Knights Radiant must stand again.

  Roshar is a world of stone swept by tempests that shape ecology and civilization. Animals and plants retract; cities are built in shelter. In centuries since ten orders of Knights fell, their Shardblade swords and Shardplate armor still transform men into near-invincible warriors. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.

  In one such war on the ruined Shattered Plains, slave Kaladin struggles to save his men and fathom leaders who deem them expendable, in senseless wars where ten armies fight separately against one foe.

  Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Fascinated by the ancient text namedThe Way of Kings and troubled by visions of ancient times, he doubts his sanity.

  Across the ocean, Shallan trains under eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar’s niece Jasnah. Though Shallan genuinely loves learning, she plans a daring theft.

  Expected by his enemies to die the miserable death of a military slave, Kaladin survived to be given command of the royal bodyguards, a controversial first for a low-status \"darkeyes.\" Now he must protect the king and Dalinar from every common peril as well as the distinctly uncommon threat of the Assassin, all while secretly struggling to master remarkable new powers that are somehow linked to his honorspren, Syl.

  The Assassin, Szeth, is active again, murdering rulers all over the world of Roshar, using his baffling powers to thwart every bodyguard and elude all pursuers. Among his prime targets is Highprince Dalinar, widely considered the power behind the Alethi throne. His leading role in the war would seem reason enough, but the Assassin's master has much deeper motives.

  Brilliant but troubled Shallan strives along a parallel path. Despite being broken in ways she refuses to acknowledge, she bears a terrible burden: to somehow prevent the return of the legendary Voidbringers and the civilization-ending Desolation that will follow. The secrets she needs can be found at the Shattered Plains, but just arriving there proves more difficult than she could have imagined.

  Meanwhile, at the heart of the Shattered Plains, the Parshendi are making an epochal decision. Hard pressed by years of Alethi attacks, their numbers ever shrinking, they are convinced by their war leader, Eshonai, to risk everything on a desperate gamble with the very supernatural forces they once fled. The possible consequences for Parshendi and humans alike, indeed, for Roshar itself, are as dangerous as they are incalculable." }, "authors": { "author": { "id": { "_text": "38550" }, "name": { "_text": "Brandon Sanderson" }, "role": {}, "image_url": { "_attributes": { "nophoto": "false" }, "_cdata": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p5/38550.jpg" }, "small_image_url": { "_attributes": { "nophoto": "false" }, "_cdata": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p2/38550.jpg" }, "link": { "_cdata": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson" }, "average_rating": { "_text": "4.36" }, "ratings_count": { "_text": "1870813" }, "text_reviews_count": { "_text": "124053" } } }, "published": { "_text": "2014" } }, { "id": { "_attributes": { "type": "integer" }, "_text": "68427" }, "isbn": { "_text": "0765350378" }, "isbn13": { "_text": "9780765350374" }, "text_reviews_count": { "_attributes": { "type": "integer" }, "_text": "5072" }, "title": { "_text": "Elantris (Elantris, #1)" }, "title_without_series": { "_text": "Elantris" }, "image_url": { "_text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1475740953m/68427.jpg" }, "small_image_url": { "_text": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1475740953s/68427.jpg" }, "large_image_url": {}, "link": { "_text": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68427.Elantris" }, "num_pages": { "_text": "638" }, "format": { "_text": "Mass Market Paperback" }, "edition_information": {}, "publisher": { "_text": "Tor Fantasy" }, "publication_day": { "_text": "30" }, "publication_year": { "_text": "2006" }, "publication_month": { "_text": "5" }, "average_rating": { "_text": "4.17" }, "ratings_count": { "_text": "100362" }, "description": { "_text": "Elantris was the capital of Arelon: gigantic, beautiful, literally radiant, filled with benevolent beings who used their powerful magical abilities for the benefit of all. Yet each of these demigods was once an ordinary person until touched by the mysterious transforming power of the Shaod. Ten years ago, without warning, the magic failed. Elantrians became wizened, leper-like, powerless creatures, and Elantris itself dark, filthy, and crumbling.

  Arelon's new capital, Kae, crouches in the shadow of Elantris. Princess Sarene of Teod arrives for a marriage of state with Crown Prince Raoden, hoping -- based on their correspondence -- to also find love. She finds instead that Raoden has died and she is considered his widow. Both Teod and Arelon are under threat as the last remaining holdouts against the imperial ambitions of the ruthless religious fanatics of Fjordell. So Sarene decides to use her new status to counter the machinations of Hrathen, a Fjordell high priest who has come to Kae to convert Arelon and claim it for his emperor and his god.

  But neither Sarene nor Hrathen suspect the truth about Prince Raoden. Stricken by the same curse that ruined Elantris, Raoden was secretly exiled by his father to the dark city. His struggle to help the wretches trapped there begins a series of events that will bring hope to Arelon, and perhaps reveal the secret of Elantris itself.

  A rare epic fantasy that doesn't recycle the classics and that is a complete and satisfying story in one volume, Elantris is fleet and fun, full of surprises and characters to care about.

  A heretic thief is the empire’s only hope in this fascinating tale that inhabits the same world as the popular novel, Elantris.

  Shai is a Forger, a foreigner who can flawlessly copy and re-create any item by rewriting its history with skillful magic. Condemned to death after trying to steal the emperor’s scepter, she is given one opportunity to save herself. Though her skill as a Forger is considered an abomination by her captors, Shai will attempt to create a new soul for the emperor, who is almost dead.

  Probing deeply into his life, she discovers Emperor Ashravan’s truest nature—and the opportunity to exploit it. Her only possible ally is one who is truly loyal to the emperor, but councilor Gaotona must overcome his prejudices to understand that Shai’s forgery is as much artistry as it is deception.

  Mistborn: Secret History builds upon the characterization, events, and worldbuilding of the original trilogy. Reading it without that background will be a confusing process at best.

  In short, this isn’t the place to start your journey into Mistborn. (Though if you have read the trilogy—but it has been a while—you should be just fine, so long as you remember the characters and the general plot of the books.)

  Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.

  It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars are fought for them, and won by them.

  When Alcatraz and Grandpa Smedry make a pilgrimage to the Free Kingdom city of Crystallia, the Smedry home base, Alcatraz is shocked to see that he is, in fact, a legend. When he was a baby he was stolen by the Evil Librarians, and his mother, a Librarian herself, was behind the whole scheme. Now, with his estranged father, who is acting indeed strange, Bastille, who has been stripped of her armor, and Grandpa Smedry, who is, as always, late to everything (that's his Talent), Alcatraz tries to save a city under siege. From who? Why, the Librarians of course!" }, "authors": { "author": { "id": { "_text": "38550" }, "name": { "_text": "Brandon Sanderson" }, "role": {}, "image_url": { "_attributes": { "nophoto": "false" }, "_cdata": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p5/38550.jpg" }, "small_image_url": { "_attributes": { "nophoto": "false" }, "_cdata": "https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1394044556p2/38550.jpg" }, "link": { "_cdata": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson" }, "average_rating": { "_text": "4.36" }, "ratings_count": { "_text": "1870813" }, "text_reviews_count": { "_text": "124053" } } }, "published": { "_text": "2009" } }, { "id": { "_attributes": { "type": "integer" }, "_text": "8562526" }, "isbn": { "_attributes": { "nil": "true" } }, "isbn13": { "_attributes": { "nil": "true" } }, "text_reviews_count": { "_attributes": { "type": "integer" }, "_text": "370" }, "title": { "_text": "Firstborn" }, "title_without_series": { "_text": "Firstborn" }, "image_url": { "_text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png" }, "small_image_url": { "_text": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png" }, "large_image_url": {}, "link": { "_text": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8562526-firstborn" }, "num_pages": { "_text": "47" }, "format": {}, "edition_information": {}, "publisher": { "_text": "Tor Books" }, "publication_day": { "_text": "14" }, "publication_year": { "_text": "2010" }, "publication_month": { "_text": "7" }, "average_rating": { "_text": "3.95" }, "ratings_count": { "_text": "5949" }, "description": { "_text": "Of the son of a High Duke of the interstellar Empire, much glory is expected.
